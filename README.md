# DRV83xx
Libary for interfacing with TI DRV83xx Motor Drivers

# Motor Controllers Supported So Far:
 - DRV8305
# Dependancies
Required:
- https://github.com/atticlabsdesign/pinctrl
- https://github.com/atticlabsdesign/pwm

Optional:
- https://github.com/atticlabsdesign/dbgcli

# Usage
For now this Library is intended for use with Microchip ARM microcontrollers using MPLAB MCC autogenerated files
SPI communication uses the MCC generated function SPI_BufferExchange
this may change in the future

files which are specific to a DRV IC are named with the full part number of the IC
files which are IC agnostic are named drv83xx...

this poject is WIP
